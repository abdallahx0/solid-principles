## Simple Application Applying SOLID Principles

This is a simple application designed to demonstrate the implementation of SOLID principles in software development.

## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented programming and design, aimed at creating more maintainable, scalable, and understandable software solutions. 
Each letter in the acronym stands for a specific principle:

### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job. 


### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle suggests that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
In other words, the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code. 

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. 
In other words, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the desirable properties of the program. 


### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. Instead of having large, monolithic interfaces, it's better to have smaller, more specific interfaces.


### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.
